;This file defines rule of determining atom types according to bondings and distances
;The lines beginning with semicolon are comment lines
;
;Each atom type starts with $ symbol, then optionally followed by atomic charge. &
;Specific definitions are given in the next line(s), the following constraint(s) can be used, each one occupies a line
;  nbond: The number of bonds the atom must form.
;  element: The element of the atom must be
;  bond: The bonding relationship must comply. The number of terms can be less than nbond. &
;For example, "bond -1 C 2 O 1 H" means the atom must simultaneously bond to a carbon with aromatic bond, &
;to an oxygen with double bond, and to a hydrogen with single bond.
;  dist: The distance criteria must comply. For example, "dist 1.05-1.1 C 1.05-1.1 C 1.19-999 O" &
;means the distance between this atom and two carbons must be both 1.05-1.1 A, at the same time, &
;the distance between this atom and an oxygen must be 1.19-999 A (i.e. at least 1.19 A).
